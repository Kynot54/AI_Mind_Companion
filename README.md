## Project Abstract ##

* The escalating prevalence of dementia, notably Alzheimer's Disease (AD), necessitates innovative early detection mechanisms to mitigate its impact and enhance the quality of life for affected individuals. This project endeavors to develop a mobile application that functions as a voice-interactive AI companion to provide a user-friendly platform for early dementia detection. Unlike existing mobile applications that employ standard cognitive tests, our AI companion facilitates natural conversation with users, analyzing their voice samples to detect early signs of dementia. Employing the advanced capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, fine-tuned for our project's objective, alongside Speech-to-Text and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, our application aims to offer a subtle and continuous analysis of a user's cognitive health.

* At the core of our application is a virtual AI friend akin to the Replika App, albeit with a primary focus on dementia detection through voice analysis rather than extensive UI or avatar customization. This AI companion is designed to adapt over time, learning about the user, thus forming a supportive "friend" that can subtly assess cognitive health during interactions. The AI's capability extends to subtly altering its interaction method based on the user's cognitive state, providing gentle suggestions for mind-engaging activities to aid in cognitive health management.

* Our project stands at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and user-centered design, aspiring to fill a significant gap in publicly available dementia detection tools. By making early dementia detection accessible through a user-friendly mobile application, we aim to foster proactive cognitive health management within the community.
