{"adrso018": " Just look at this one and tell me everything you see going on. Oh, Mom. Mom ain't having a good day. She's not having a good day at all. The kids are in the cookie jar. And the, not the ladder, but the high chair is turning over. She's preoccupied with him, even though she's not looking at him. And she forgot to turn her water off and her sink is overflowing, getting her floor wet. And her daughter, the little boy's sister, she's just laughing. She's having a ball. She's enjoying every minute of this. But at the same time, she wants a cookie before you fall. And it's just kind of a chaotic day for her. But she seems to have a smile on her face. I guess she said, well. That's all of it in the day. I just deal with it as it comes. All right. Thank you.", "adrso019": " Okay, little boy is on a stool that looks like he's going to fall. He's going to the cookie jar and the stool looks like it's going to fall over because it's like bending and the little girl is pointing and he's handing her a cookie. And mom is drying the dishes and all the water is coming out of the sink, overflowing. And she's not paying attention to that. She's looking straight instead of looking at what she's doing. And there's a cabinet in that room and there's a plate and two cups. And you can look outside the window and you see a walkway. You see grass. You see another window with a curtain. And in the room that she's in has a curtain and there's a window. And I think that's it.", "adrso003": " Starting from the left, I see two children standing on a tipping stool, reaching for the cookie jar. The boy is up on the top of the stool, obviously getting the cookies for his younger sister. Mom is washing the dishes while the sink is overflowing. Yeah, doing the dishes. And I'm not really sure what's going on out there, out on the other side of the window. So there's some dishes there on the sink that remain to be done.", "adrso017": " All right, we have a few more tasks to go through before we break for today. Okay. So here's a picture. Just tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Well, there's a guy up in the tree, and the dog is barking at the guy. Oh, I'm sorry. I gave you the wrong one. That was my fault. That was my fault. Okay. All right. Yeah, tell me what's going on in this picture. I see a boy robbing the cookie jar, and apparently his sister wanting a cookie, but he's about to have an accident in the process of robbing the cookie jar. And I see the mother washing dishes and the sink overflowing because she has the water on, and the sink is full, and she must have to stop her in place. She... may be in danger of slipping since there's water on the floor. And the boys, it looks like... I think I said that already. I think the boy's about to have an accident. So... Great. Okay.", "adrso005": " Oh my, such a mess, the sink is overflowing. And I don't know why, she's trying, not even caring. She meaning the wife or mother. While the kids are, one of the kids is falling off the stool. Big accident momentarily. It's, possibly she's looking out of the window, she doesn't look, she looks unhappy, she's got a frown on her face. And walking in the puddle of water that's coming out of the sink, that's really, no, it doesn't look like a terribly organized way of life here in this kitchen. Of course the boy is going to fall on the ground and crash with, some of the cookies will also come out onto the ground. That's, there's something going on outside, nothing serious though. Just, the rest of the house on the sidewalk. That's about all.", "adrso002": " Okay, I see a mom doing the dishes and the water's overflowing from the sink and she seems to be completely oblivious of it. The children in the picture, who I presume are hers, are climbing. One of the boys is climbing on a, or standing on a stool that's about to fall over, putting his hand in the cookie jar on the top shelf and his sister or cousin or whoever the girl is, is reaching up for a cookie. The window is open, there's a pathway with garden on either side, it looks like. There's something else on the sink, I mean on the countertop, dishes. And that's, the mother has an apron on, she is dressed in the Mrs. Beaver style with a very, with an apron and a nice dress and shoes and so forth. And I don't understand why she's not turning the water off, but that's part of the deal. And there's curtains on the window and there's panes in the window, small panes.", "adrso022": " And then here on this one, tell me everything you see going on in this picture. Well, I see the mother is not paying attention and her water is running over her sink. The boy has climbed up on a ladder to steal some cookies and he's falling over. The girl is laughing. The grass is growing outside. Nobody seems to care. They're just going on with their daily activities. Anything else you see? No right or wrong answers, but is there anything else you see going on in the picture? No, not really.", "adrso014": " I see a woman who has zoned out. She's in a world of her own, obviously. She isn't aware of what's going on. Her son obviously is caught. Maybe it's not her son. Maybe she's just the caretaker or the babysitter, and maybe that would give her a reason for being a little disengaged here. But at any rate, the boy is about to have an accident. He may very well pull the whole cookie jar down with him. And this woman is oblivious to the fact that the sink is running over. As soon as it gets ankle deep, I think she'll wake up. And when she hears the crash, she definitely will be brought to the present. Otherwise, it looks like a beautiful day outside. Is there anything else I should say about this picture?", "adrso016": " A lot of fall and safety problems. So this boy is getting cookies from a cookie jar and the stool is tipping. I'm not sure what his sister is doing. I think she just wants a cookie. But the mother's not paying attention to the water falling out of the sink. And she's drying dishes. So I'm not sure. And she's cleaning the water. And there's a nice window. But I don't see anything much else going on. Great. Thank you.", "adrso007": " Our mother standing by the sink, kind of looks like lost in thought, wiping a dish. The sink is overflowing with water. She doesn't seem too concerned. A boy is on a stool that's about to tip over. He's in the cookie jar. His sister's got her hand up, reached, waiting for a cookie. And the mother seems oblivious to what they're doing.", "adrso010": " Let's see, Mama appears to be busy doing the dishes. Wow, she's had a problem. The sink is running over. And meanwhile, while she's distracted, the son and daughter are off into the cookie jar. And, horrors, he's about to fall.", "adrso008": " Well, I see what seems to be a mother, or could be a babysitter with two children, a boy and a girl. The kids are after the cookies, and the little boy is going to hurt himself really badly. And the mother is in not too good a shape either because there's water spilling out of the sink, and her feet are going to get wet. She could slip. She could break the dishes. She could really hurt herself. The little girl, I think she's safe enough, though it looks like she's a little worried. It's a beautiful day. The windows are open. The curtains are... Well, it's not too windy because the curtains seem to be in place. Other than that, it seems a very sweet home. And probably a little few years ago, not right now.", "adrso012": " Well, I see a kitchen and a housewife or homemaker at the sink and her two kids are having a great time. She is drying a dish as her sink overflows. She must be blind, but that's her doing. Also, the kid is about to fall having unsuccessfully gotten a cookie out of the cookie jar. That's the boy who's up on a stool and the daughter is there trying to grab the cookie, I guess, from the boy. What else? It looks like a nice yard in back with a bit of a garden. Some grass, I believe. She's standing in the water. It still bothers me that she's gone blind, that she can't, well, she'll feel it soon on her feet when the water hits her. That's what I see.", "adrso015": " Okay. I'm going to show you some pictures, okay? Here's a picture. Tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Okay, mom is washing dishes, but the sink is running over with water. The little boy is trying to get cookies on the step stool that's fallen, and the sister doesn't care about the steps. She's got the window open, which is very unusual. And there are dishes on the counter. Is that it? All right. You talking about action stuff? Anything like overall picture? Yeah. Okay. Anything that you see happening? It's like a big picture. They're close to... I wonder if that's part of their house or if it's their next-door neighbor. Hmm. Could be. Could be a walk to the garage, or it could be a next-door neighbor. I didn't even notice that.", "adrso021": " Everything you see going on in this picture. Ground safety hazards, as they refer to in the military. The kid on the stool that's about to fall, and the woman sitting there blase while her sink runs over on the floor. Let's see, the little girl, what is she asking for, a cookie while her brother's falling down the stool? That's about it. Two accidents happening in the middle of two accidents happening here. She's standing in water, so it's going to be slippery. So she's liable to, besides the water running over the sink, it's kind of funny the way that sink's drawn, the way it looks like it's all splashing over the front. I don't really see anything else in the picture of significance. Am I supposed to see something else in the picture of significance? None of those hidden things, where the face is in the corner. It looks like the typical pencil sketch of a domestic scene where everything goes wrong.", "adrso160": " One more thing, what I want you to do is take a look at that picture and tell me everything you see happening, everything that's going on. Well, the water's running over on the floor. The chair is tilting. The boy's into the cookie jar. And his sister is reaching for a cookie. The mother's drying dishes. Do you want action or just want anything I see? Just that. Okay. Okay, thanks very much. Mm-hmm.", "adrso023": " Tell me everything you see going on in this picture. This one? Yes, ma'am. Oh, a little boy fixing a flaw off a stool, trying to get a cookie for his sister, I guess. And then the mother's washing dishes and her sink is running. Oh, man. Oh. And she's washing dishes and drying them. Can you see anything else going on? I mean, there are no right or wrong answers. I just want to be sure you're good. No, just the water spilling in the floor and the little boy and girl. He's fixing a flaw, trying to get the cookies. I can't see anything going on outside. Yeah. Great. Thank you very much.", "adrso157": " Okay, and there's the picture. Oh, yes. Just go ahead and tell you? You just say it. The mother is drying a plate. The water's sink is clogged, and there's more water going over it, and it's splashing onto the floor. And the boy's falling off the stool getting cookies from the cookie jar. And the girl's putting her finger up to her lip, which means I won't tell or something like that. Shoes are getting wet in the mother. I'm looking outside. I don't see it doing anything. Snowy? It's about the... All the actual snow. I see it. The water's going over, and the boy's falling off the stool. Okay. Fine. I don't know that snow is action. I don't see it snowing. It looks white out there. I don't know. I don't know.", "adrso173": " What I want you to do is take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see happening in this picture. I want you to tell me everything that's going on here. Everything, not things that are just bad, right? Right. It's everything that's going on. There are two little kids, a boy and a girl, boys on a stool which is falling over, getting cookies out of a jar. The cookies are in the cabinet with the lid off and it's in the kitchen. The mother is washing dishes at the window with a curtain on the window. Walk outside with trees and grass. Water is running over in the sink onto the floor. The mother is drying a dish and stepping in the water. There's a plate and two cups sitting on the cabinet. The mother has an egg growing. Okay.", "adrso164": " What do you see going on? I see a little boy on a stool almost falling over, taking cookies out of the cookie jar. And the little girl is putting her finger to her mouth to keep it quiet. The mother is washing dishes. She's drying the dishes and letting the water keep on running in the sink, and the water is running over, and she's standing in the water that's running over. There's a window there, and she's looking out at the grass and the flowers. And the... curtains seem to be shaking from the wind and the air that's blowing in. The dishes that she's through drying are sitting on the sink top. And the little girl's raising her hands for the little boy to hand her a cookie. And he has one cookie in his hand, and he's holding it in his hand. And he's going after another one. And he's ready to hand her her cookie. The mother is holding a dish cloth that she's drying the dishes with. She has a platter that she's drying. I don't see any other action. That's fine.", "adrso159": " So the action that you see going on in that picture. Anything that I want. Okay. The boy's reaching for cookies and the stool is falling over. The girl is reaching for her brother to give her a cookie. The mother is doing dishes. But the water is spilling over on the floor. The wind is open. The baby is moving. The baby is moving. The baby is moving. The baby is moving. The baby is moving. The baby is moving. Did you just want action or just. Oh, okay.", "adrso165": " I'm in the picture. Girl is reaching up. The boy is taking cookies out of the cookie jar. The stool is tilting. Mother is washing the dishes. The water is running over. The wind is blowing the curtains. Mother is drying the dishes. The boy is reaching down to, I guess, his sister. The boy is climbing, but he's going to fall. The mother is drying the dishes. I think I said that. The water is running and running down. That's all I see on that. Okay. Okay.", "adrso169": " there's a kid stealing cookies from the cookie jar the stool's about to topple over his sister's asking for one the cookie jar is open of course the cupboard's open the mother's drying dishes the sink is overflowing there are some dishes on the sideboard the window's open I don't know what else you want there are curtains in the window and there's windows", "adrso172": " Good, and here's the picture. First of all, the sink is overflowing. Mother is washing dishes or an adult is washing dishes. There are two children in the cookie jar. One is on a stool and the stool is overturning. The little girl is reaching for a cookie from the little boy as the stool falls over. There is a window and bushes and path outside the window. And a glimpse of another window and another part of the house. There are curtains with tie backs. There are dishes. There are dish towels. There are dish towels. Now, there is only one dish towel. I thought I said there was only one dish towel. Two cups, plate, cabinets, apron, grass and trees, floor, counter space, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen,", "adrso161": " Well, this little boy is up on his stool taking cookies, handing them down to his sister, and she's telling him to be quiet, and the stool is tipping over. The mother is washing, or drying dishes. The water is running into the sink and running over down onto the floor. The wind must be blowing because the curtains look like they're... The kitchen door, the cabinet door is open. The mother is standing in water. That's it. Okay, good.", "adrso154": " That's the picture. The boy is taking cookies from the cookie jar, giving one to his sister, also falling off the stool he is on. The mother is washing dishes, letting the sink overflow, getting all over the floor. I see nothing. The girl is saying be quiet. Does that count? Mm-hmm. I don't know what the mother gets by standing in the water. That's all I see. Okay, thank you. What have I missed? . .", "adrso156": " Just everything that you see happening. Oh, wow. Well, the mother must be daydreaming because the water's overflowing in the sink. And the window's open. She's drawing a dish. Maybe she's dead. The boy's in the cookie jar, going in the cookie jar, giving his sister, and he's about to fall off the stool. And the sister is, well, the little girl, whether it's sister or not, but the little girl has her finger to her mouth as if she's trying to get him to be quiet. What else can I tell you about this picture? There's a garage or house next door. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.", "adrso152": " The little boy is on the stool, which is tipping over, and he's getting into the cookie jar, which is up in the cabinet. The lid is off the jar. He has a cookie in one hand, which he can have in another one. The little girl has her hand up for a cookie, I guess, to take from him, and one hand is up to her mouth, like she doesn't want Mother to know. Mother is doing the dishes at the sink, and the sink is overflowing. The water is overflowing on the floor. She's drying a dish. There's some, looks like two cups, and they were a gallon. Outside the window, it looks like a pan. There's another window, and some trees, and grass, and some shrubs. And it's either, I guess it's another part of the house, because there's a curtain. There's curtains on her windows. She has an apron on her.", "adrso168": " Tell me everything that you see happening in that picture. Everything you see going on. Alright, the boy is getting into the cookie jar. He's got one in his hand, but the stool is falling over as he's reaching for the cookies. The girl is laughing at him.

There are, looks like two cups and a plate on the sink. There's a set of kitchen cabinets. The mother has on an apron and a sleeve of this dress. The girl has on a dresser, a skirt and blouse. The boy looks like he's got on short trousers and a shirt with a sweater. Cookie jar is full of cookies. Cookie jar is full of cookies. The lid is off. That's it.", "adrso170": " Why don't you take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see going on in that picture. Everything that you see happening.

The sink is overflowing. I'm getting on her shoes. There are saucers and a plate on the... But you want to know what's going on. You want me to tell you what's on the sink too and everything? Oh, well that's all I see happening.", "adrso148": " This should make us laugh. Are you ready? Mm-hmm. Well, the sink is overflowing. Mother was standing in the water like a jerk. She's wiping the dishes also like a jerk. The boy is trying to get a cookie out of the cookie jar, but boy, he's about to fall off the stool. So his sister has her hand, finger up to her mouth like she's saying, Shh, be quiet. Tell my mother what you're doing. And he's about to hand her a cookie, but in a few moments it's going to be like total catastrophe. Mother, the reason the water is flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously. And I'm looking out through the window, and I don't see anything going on out there. Unless that's just a bush, I'm presuming, or a plumber. I'm putting. I told you the stool is about to go over. And in a moment there's going to be real chaos, which will make what's going on in the picture look like nothing. The cookie jar is full. The lid is off the cookie jar. Do you want me to tell you all those things? Tell me all the things you see going on in the picture. The cabinet door has just swung open. The stool is about to fall. I guess I've told you that with the terrible crash. Mother is daydreaming. She doesn't even know what's going on behind her. I think that's very important and sometimes typical. Seems to... Okay, that's fine.", "adrso167": " What I'd like you to do is just look at the picture and tell me anything at all that you see going on. Children are getting into the cookie jar. The little boy who's on the stew is about to fall because the stew is going to topple over. Mother has her back turned and is drying the dishes. The sink is full of water and the water is beginning to spill over onto the floor. The sink is in front of a window. One can look out the window and see a path and what is obviously a yard. There's a plate and two cups or dishes on the counter. The children getting into the cookie jar. There's one boy and one girl. The cookie jar is labeled cookie jar. The cupboard door is open. There are curtains at the kitchen window. The mother is wearing an apron. She has a sleeveless dress and short hair. The little girl has straps on her shoes. The stool is a three-legged stool.

Two face cabinets, four doors. Thanks, Miss. Balance. Windows half open. And there's landscape along the wall and a view from the yard. And a walkway. Picture from the window.

It seems to me that that's essentially the things that are going on in this picture. Okay. Okay. The girl is picking her nose. The boy is handing her a cookie. Really, those are the only activities I see. Okay.", "adrso178": " What I want you to do is to look at this picture and tell me everything that you see going on, everything that you see happening in that picture. Beginning now? Yeah. Boys getting, reaching for cookies, the stool is falling over, his sister is reaching for cookies, the woman's wiping the dishes, the sink is running over, curtains are blowing a little bit but not much. The boy is stepping on one of his own toes. The little girl is telling him to be quiet, don't let mommy see. That's all. That's everything then? That's about it, yeah.", "adrso264": " And there's the picture. Just all of the action. You want me to describe everything? Yeah, tell me the action. Yeah, you can just, you know. Okay. What's going on? Well, the boy is getting cookies from a cookie jar. A little girl is reaching up with her hand to receive one. And the boy is in danger of falling because the stool he's on is tilting. That would be on the other side. The mother is drying the dishes. The water is running over, spilling on the floor. She's stepping in the water. She's looking out the window instead of paying attention to the horses and dishes. Okay.", "adrso262": " Okay, you can start now. Okay, the mother is wiping a dish at the sink. The water is overflowing from the sink. A youngster is about to fall off a stool, reaching for a cookie jar, and the little girl is holding up her hand to grab a cookie out of his hand. The window appears to be open, but I can't make out any action in the background there. That's all. Okay, that's fun.", "adrso183": " I want you to tell me everything you see happening in that picture, everything that's going on there. The boy is reaching into the cookie jar. He's falling off the stool. The little girl is reaching for a cookie. Mother is drying the dishes. The sink is running over. Mother is getting her feet wet. They all have shoes on. There's a cup, two cups and a saucer on the sink. The window has withdrawn drapes. You look out on the driveway. The window has withdrawn drapes. You look out on the driveway. There's kitchen cabinets. There's kitchen cabinets. Tell me what's happening. Tell me what's happening. Oh, what's happening. Mother is looking out the window. The girl is touching her lips. The boy is standing on his right foot. His left foot is sort of up in the air. Mother's right foot is flat on the floor and her left, she's on her left toe. Mother's right foot is flat on the floor and her left, she's on her left toe. She's holding the dishcloth in her right hand and the plate. She is drying in her left. I think I've run out of. Yeah, I think so. All right, thanks.", "adrso260": " And you can begin right there. Well, the little boy's on a step stool trying to reach the cookie jar and it's falling. And the girl is reaching for a cookie he has in his hand. Mama's washing dishes and the sink's running over. She's drying a plate. And the sink is running over down on the floor. The window is up. And is that all? Anything else? Is there anything else? Well, there's a plate with two cups on the counter. Is that enough? That's fine. Sure. That's good. I don't see it.", "adrso180": " And tell me everything you see happening in that picture, everything that's going on there. I mean right now, I'll tell you. Yeah. The boy is stealing cookies out of the jar, and he's on a stool that's falling down, and the girl is laughing at him, and the mother is washing dishes, but she's preoccupied, and the water is flowing over the sink, and there's trouble galore. The wind is blowing the curtains. She is not paying any attention to her kids, and the boy, in addition to stealing, he's trying to give the girl a cookie, and the whole thing is going to collapse. But aside from that, they seem to be a fairly happy family.", "adrso274": " All right, the boy is taking a cookie out of the cookie jar and he has one in his left hand to reach down to give to his, well he has it in his left hand. His sister or girl is reaching up for a cookie and has her index finger or her right hand pointed upward close to her mouth. And I'm, maybe she's saying shh because they're going to have to be quiet because the stool is going to fall over. The boy has his right heel on his left toe and he's wearing running shoes with pom poms on them. And his socks look pretty sloppy. I observed that the, one of the two slippers that the girl is wearing. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Looks as if its sole is thicker than the one, the left one is thicker than the right. The woman is, uh, letting the sink run over. The water is running full tilt onto the, and overflowing the sink. She's drying a plate and she has a towel in her right hand and looks as if she has something else. You know that's the, curtain. The back, the end of the curtain is behind her, the plate in her left hand. She has her left side of the window. She's already dried a plate and two cups. The window is open and you can see the path outside going around the back of the house and another room in the house. The window is also open, I believe. She's standing with her foot in the water. The water isn't running out of it but it's splashing up and the right shoe is in the water puddle. And that's what I found. I'm going to go back to the house. I'm going to go back to the house. Okay, thank you. And the kitchen. And the kitchen.", "adrso186": " Tell me everything you see happening in the mattress room, everything that's going on there. Okay. Well, in the first place, the mother forgot to turn off the water and the water's running out the sink. And she's standing there, thrown on the floor. The child has got a stool and reaching up into the cookie jar and the stool is tipping over and he's sort of put down the plates and she's reaching up to get it. But I don't see anything wrong with her, though. Okay. Yes, that's it. I can't see anything.", "adrso276": " Oh, it's the same picture. You should give me a different one. Yes. We're afraid to. Why? It would be more fun if you had some variety. That's probably true. Okay. We have here a scene in the kitchen, and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the sink and her two children. And the two children are hoping that mama will not notice, because she's looking out the window, that they are getting into the cookie jar. So the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar, and as he's getting up there, the stool is tilting, and he looks as though he were about to fall over. And the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips. He has one cookie in his hand, is reaching for another one. The lid is off the cookie jar. The cupboard door is open. He's supposedly going to hand one cookie, it looks as though he is, to his sister and grab another one for himself. But I doubt that he's going to get all that done before the stool falls over. On the other, around the corner of the kitchen, there's a counter that sort of turns a corner. There are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are. Then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen, you have vase cabinets and then you have a window above that, which is looking out into something which makes it look as though it's summer outside, because the window is open. There are things growing out there. There's a walk. There's some shrubbery underneath another window that looks as though it's in another wing of the house. There's a tree. There's a tree beyond. There are tie-back curtains at the window. The mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on, and apparently there's no overflow in the sink, so it's overflowing right onto the floor, splice, splice. And she has on a sleeveless dress, which also indicates that it's summer. It looks as though she has an apron on. She has short hair. She is drying a dish with a tea towel, a plate with a tea towel. Beside the sink, there are three things. There are two cups and a plate. Looks as though there's some suds and some dishes in the sink. And two faucets with X-type handles, one on either side and a center faucet. She has shoes on with no ties, just sort of slip-on shoes. There's a little scalloped valance across the top of the curtains. Hmm. I think that's all I'm going to tell you. Well, the handles on the door are the kind that are just almost like a round piece of wood that you have to get a hold of to pull the cupboard door open. And what's really strange is that you can't see any handles on the cupboards on the other side of the kitchen. Okay.", "adrso316": " I'd like you to tell me everything that you see going on in the picture. And that's the picture. Action type things. There is water coming out of a faucet into a basin which is overflowing onto the floor. The mother is drying dishes and she's walking in the water that is flowing on the floor. Two children are stealing cookies. One of whom is up on a stool that is about to fall. He's removing cookies from an upper shelf in the closet. The wind appears to be blowing because the curtains appear to be puffed. Those are the only action things that I can see.", "adrso281": " There's a cookie jar on the shelf and the little boy is up on a stool and the stool is about to fall. The stool is about to turn. The little girl in the picture is reaching for the cookie. Mother is washing dishes. The water is running and running over onto the floor. She has a plate in her hand and a towel she's drying. Two cups are sitting on a counter and also a plate. You can see out through the kitchen window to another part of the house and a drive, walkway away from the house. You can see a window across in the other part of the house, the roof, a tree, there are curtains on the window. There's a little girl in the picture. There's a little girl in the picture.", "adrso310": " Okay, I just want you to tell me what you see going on in that picture. Well, the water's running over. The boy's going to fall off the stool. The girl is saying, give me winter, I will tell. And the boy's taking the second one out of the cookie jar. The lid's going to fall off. The mother's drying the dishes. The window is open. She's standing in the water. She's drying the dishes. Anything else? Wait, what's in the picture? What's going on? What's going on? Just what's going on. Okay, so that's going to be action. That's all. Okay.", "adrso298": " A little girl is reaching for her brother to give her a cookie. The stool is falling over. The boy has taken the lid off the cookie jar. His cookie in his left hand is reaching with his right hand for one. The mother is drying the dishes. The water is running and flowing out of the sink. The mother is frowning. There's nothing going on outside. There's just bushes. The door is open. The girl looks like she's laughing. The boy is standing in the water. The girl is standing in the water. Okay, that's it. That's fine.", "adrso289": " and that's the picture climbing dish washing pointing stealing cookies wind is blowing outside you see the grass moving a little bit the water is flowing the stool is um it's being heavy doors open i'm sorry she stepping to a step motion of the hands pointing in the emotion on the lips reaching cookie jar our lid is falling the door is open the sink is overflowing but i said the water is flowing it's coming out of the faucet and splashing okay", "adrso312": " What do you see going on in that picture? Oh, I see the sink that's running over. I see the store is tipping over. The little boy is trying to get cookies out. The girl is reaching to get a cookie. The mother is drying dishes. The window is open. Did I say she's washing? Oh, she's drying dishes. I don't know what's going on. And she's standing in the water. The cupboard door is open. There's a cookie jar. They're just leaning against the cookie jar. There's curtains on the window. I can see the grass and some shrubbery outside in the house next door. Okay. Kitchen cabinets. Is that it? Mm-hmm. I feel I see three people in there, a mother and a little boy and a girl. Okay. Is that it?", "adrso309": " Tell me everything that's going on in there. Mother is drying the dishes, looking out the window, not paying any attention. The water is spilling all over the floor and the sink. The window is open. The children are behind mother, stealing cookies out of the cookie jar. The boy has climbed up on the stool which is tipping over. He's getting cookies out of the cookie jar, handing them to his sister. His shoes are untied, he's going to fall. The cupboard door is open, the lid is off the cookie jar. Mother's feet are getting wet. She must be in outer space and she doesn't notice all this that's going on. Okay. Okay, thanks.", "adrso302": " We'll start with the girl. She's going to the E.C. Her brother is taking cookies out of a jar. And he got careless. She's asking him for one. So he's handing one down to her. In the meantime, he is getting ready to fall off of a stool, a three-legged stool. And the mother is not paying much attention. She's looking out the window. And in looking out the window, why is she letting her sink run over in the water splashing on the floor all over her? And the outside looks all right. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, I'm mixed up. You got fired. She's drying a dish. And she has two cups and a plate on the table. Well, I did say she was letting the water run over the sink down onto the floor, splashing onto her feet. Tree. Then I climbed the tree. There's an angle here that is incomplete of the corner where it all comes together. Child and hospital. I'm going to the hospital in Philadelphia to see my child. There's a plate. Two cups. Oh, I did say she's letting the water run over the sink, didn't I? Cold and winter. She seems to be looking out the window while she's drying her dish. Well, it's... How about that?", "adrso296": " Oh, the sink's running over. Water's gone all over the floor. Here, the boy, the stepladder's turning under his legs, and he's stealing cookies out of the cookie jar. And she's begging for cookies, the girl. Coming back to the sink, let's see here. Oh, Mama's stepping in the water. I said the sink was running over. She's drying dishes. There's something, but I don't know what it is, written on the grass, it seems. Oh, I never noticed that. I don't know. And the curtains. That's a TV or something. I don't see anything else there. She's stepping in the water. It's like running over. Oh. That spells something down there, but I can't see it. How am I made out so far? And he's on a stool that's going to fall over while he's stealing cookies. There's a plate and two cups on the sink, and she's got a plate in her hand. I don't see. I don't see anything. Okay.", "adrso277": " So I'm going to show you a picture that has a lot of action going on in it. What I need you to do is tell me all of the action you see going on in the picture. Okay? And here's the picture. Show me all the action. Just tell me all the action out loud. What picture are you? No, you're in the back. Oh, okay. Boy is on a stool getting cookies from the cookie jar and giving them to the girl. The stool is about ready to tip over. The mother is drying the dishes and the sink faucet has filled the sink bowl and is running over onto the floor. Okay. That's all the action. Thank you.", "adrso307": " down in the picture the boys the girl's making fun of the boys she made fun of him so much while he was stealing a cookie out of the cookie jar and it made him trip and he's going to follow the mothers listening to the kids she's drying dishes she's got the window and it's a mirror she isn't paying attention to the sink the sink spilling water onto the floor is getting her feet wet the curtains are open to allow uh fresh air to come in the house there's two uh cups on the that dish on the sink and the faucets are open and the cupboard doors open uh looks like it might be spring or summer because things look like they're growing on site if she has shoes on she has shoes on he has shoes on she has shoes on she has dress dress apron shirt shorts socks socks and the lids off the cookie jar there's a fancy sink cabinet over here and a fancy wall cabinet over there that's about it okay good", "adrso299": " I want you to take a look at this picture, and I want you to tell me everything that's happening there. Everything that's going on in that picture. Okay, is there a number of things? I mean, do I have to come up with a certain amount? No, just whatever you see happening there. Okay. Number one, the boy's stealing some cookies, and he's falling over from the chair. It's not sitting straight, and the sink is overflowing. Do you want to know everything that's wrong with the picture? Everything that's happening. Everything that's happening. Okay. It looks like it's a nice summer day outside, and the lady's drying the dishes, and everything that's happening. She's standing in the water. Let me find her. The girl seems to be giggling. Looks like the... The mother's a little P.O'd. And... Okay, fine. That's good. Thank you very much.", "adrso291": " What I'd like you to do here is take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see happening, everything that you see going on. Do I start? Mm-hmm. The children are getting into the cookie jar, which is on the high above the sink. They have the lid off the cookie jar. The boy has two in his hand, and the girl is reaching up for them. And the stool in which he stands is about to upset. The door is open to get the cookie jar. The mother, presumably, is at the sink washing dishes, and the sink is running over the water, splashing down on the floor. There are two, I suppose, dry dishes on the sink. She has one in her hand, a plate that she is drying. She has it on an apron. The sink is below a window with a path out into a garden. There are shrubbery to the left of the path, and you can see beyond that another window. And I don't know what that is, whether those are flowers or weeds. And this is part of the house. You can see the roof of maybe all of the house and the curtains. That's about all. The curtains are drawn back.", "adrso315": " Just the action. The girl is reaching for a cookie that the boy is trying to get for her. Am I going too fast? Wow, he's falling off the ladder. The mother is washing dishes, drying a plate, while the sink is spilling over with water that has overflown from the spigot that is still running. The water is gushing out. The girl is signaling to be quiet, not to let the mother know that the boy is getting the cookie for her. And I did say that she's drying the dish with the towel. And the water is splashing on the floor.", "adrso283": " That is the picture. It doesn't matter where you start, you know? Alright, there's a little boy on a step stool, which is tilted, and he's getting some cookies. Now, do you want descriptive as far as the cookies are, or how they are, or just the action? Just the action. Okay, and it looks like he's trying to hand a cookie to his sister. She kind of has her finger up towards her mouth, like she might be giggling. The mother's drying dishes, but the water is overflowing onto the floor. ... ... ... ... ... Now we should call the the cup and the saucers. That's not action, right, is it? No, you don't. The breeze might be blowing. The curtains look like they might be. ... ... ... ... ... ...", "adrso286": " Tell me everything that you see going on in the picture. Just tell me what's happening there. Well, one thing, this boy's on the stool getting cookies. His stool's about to fall, and the little girl's reaching for some cookies. She's got her finger in her mouth. Mother's drying dishes, and water's running over. She's drying dishes, water's running over. She's standing in the water. There's a sink there, plate, cup. Outside, you can see outside there, the walkway, edges, window, tree. Outside, the cookery job would have to be in public. And there's a, what's it called, a con around in the kitchen. That's in the curtains in the window. Okay. Right.", "adrso308": " It's a kitchen scene. The mother is doing the dishes. The children are trying to get into the cookie jar. The stool is falling over. The water is running over in the sink. The window is open and there is grass and what have you. Grass and trees outside. Looks like the curtains might be billowing a little. The little girl is asking the boy for a cookie. And let's see, the mother is drying the dishes. And she's standing in the water. Looks like there are a couple dishes that have already been dried sitting on the sink. I guess that's all I see. Hey, what's going on over here? Pardon me? Tell me this again. I might have missed what you said. Oh, I said the little boy is trying to get some cookies out of the cookie jar. And the little girl is asking for a cookie. And the stool looks as though it's going to fall over.", "adrso285": " Touching lip, raising arm, is that what you mean? Reaching for cookie, handing cookie down, slipping from stool, stool falling over, wiping dishes, water running, water overflowing, stepping out from water. I guess that's it. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Good.", "adrso300": " Okay, there's a child reaching for a cookie. The chair is tilted. The girls are possibly moving their finger towards their mouth and reaching for a cookie. Water is running out of the sink. And the mother is drying dishes. And they're going to be screaming in the kitchen. And the mother is asking. And there's action, but they're standing in the water. And the mother asks her.", "adrso292": " Now let's see. Children are getting cookies. The school is going to fall. The sink is overflowing. The mother is washing or drying dishes. The girl is putting her finger up to her mouth. Like I said, the mother doesn't know. They took the lid off the cookie drawer. They opened the door. And that's all.", "adrso278": " Any action or anything you see that's going on? Oh, well, the sink's overflowing, the lady's washing dishes, the boy's up on the stools, he's falling, he's getting cookies out of the cooking, the girl's reaching up for the cookies, the window's open, the door's open to the cabin, that's about it.", "adrso162": " Okay, here's the picture. Okay, mother is drying the dishes, but the water is flowing out over the sink under the floor. It's a pretty day outside. Lots of flowers. There are three dishes left to wash. She's standing in the water, which is dangerous. The children are getting into the cookie jar. The boy's up there on the stool, and it's almost falling over. He's got one cookie in his hand. He's handing it to the little girl, and he's getting another one out of the cookie jar. Did you say action that's going on? Uh-huh. The little girl is kind of... Looks like she's trying either to be quiet or she's laughing. I don't know. She doesn't seem to be paying much attention. She looks like she's looking at the moon. The water is splashing onto the floor. Okay. That's it. Good.", "adrso261": " A boy with a cookie in his one hand and his hand in the cookie jar, standing on a stool which is tipping over. The little girl's got her hand up for one, and I don't know what the hand means to the mouth. Does it mean she wants to eat? The kitchen sink is running over, the water running out. It's on the floor. The mother is drying the dishes, frowning but not turning off the faucet. Uh... Two cups on the counter. Plate. Mother's standing in the middle of the water. Curtains at the windows. Lids falling off the bookings are on. The cupboard's half open. That's it. Okay.", "adrso265": " Now you just look at the picture and just tell me everything that's going on. Okay? This is going to be like looking at those artistic things in Italy when we get there. We'll be at her dishwashers. Her dish sink is overflowing on the floor because the faucet is running. And she's standing in it yet. Her kiddos are robbing the jar and the little boy is falling off the stool. He's getting some cookies though. And the girl doesn't have those yet. I don't think the perspective in the corner is quite right or wrong. How many dishes? Two cups and a plate on the counter. And she's drying a plate. And, you know, all these curtains on the window. She's pie-backs. And a little pretty view out there. And then you see the... The wing of the house. The living room. And the path around the house. And landscaping is bushes up close. And, you know, like... Coffee everythings and stuff. And outside there's grass in the ground. And there's a tree. And I think it's... Okay. Could you repeat to me what you said over there? Yeah. I didn't get it out. He's getting cookies out of the cookie jar. He's falling off the stool. Two cookies already. He's giving one to his sister. And he's going to have one. Even if he falls, he's going to have his cookies. She has her finger up her mouth. I know that she's saying, Sure, I want one too. I don't know how the mother can be so unaware. Okay, that's fine. Thank you.", "adrso259": " The mother is washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing. She has some of them dried already on the side as she's looking out the window. The little boy is falling off the stool as he's getting into the cookie jar to give to his little sister who's reaching up to get the cookie also. There's water all over the floor and there's the garden is outside and the mother is not paying any attention to what they do. The stool is tipping. The cookie jar, the door is open. They may get a little breeze coming in because this window is open. The little girl is saying, has her finger to her mouth, shh, we won't tell mother while you give me the cookie. Okay. It's in the kitchen of course and the cups, two cups in the dish already have been dried and the mother is stepping in the water and she's probably so engrossed in what she's doing outside she either knows what the children are doing or is she paying any attention that the water is overflowing. Okay, good.", "adrso268": " Here's the picture. Alrighty, the action I see is a little girl with her finger up to her mouth and one arm extended up, looking up at the boy who's reaching up to the cookie jar with his right hand reaching for a cookie, with his left hand he already has a cookie, it almost looks like the girl's trying to reach for a cookie in the lower left hand. He's standing on the stool, it's tipping over, and looks like he's about ready to fall. The woman in the sink looks like she's wiping a dish with a rag in her hand, holding the dish with the other hand, and water's flowing into the sink and over the sink, it looks like she's not paying attention to it. Water's just flowing out of the sink and all over the floor, and she's stepping into the water too, it's... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...", "adrso151": " Okay, here's the picture. All the action you see going on. Boy taking cookies out of the cookie jar. The stool is falling. A little girl is reaching. Water is running out of the faucet. Water is overflowing the sink. Woman is pushing dishes. Drying dishes. There's nothing there to keep women from going out and seeing the watch. Okay, good. That's fine.", "adrso257": " Just look at the picture and tell me everything that you see. Somebody's getting cookies out of the cookie jar, standing by the store. The store's got a tip of a hat here. A girl's standing step with somebody here and the other's without any dishes. The water's running out over the floor. Cups and plates are sitting on the counter. You look out the window and see the shrubbery. The lid's sideways from the cookie jar. The door's open and the can opener. Another parent just didn't notice one of them. Curtains are hanging on the window. Window's open. The window's open. Okay.", "adrso267": " going on in the picture. Okay, there it is. Yes, carry on. Kids are taking cookies from the cookie jar. Mother is doing dishes. Sink is overflowing. The window is open. The stool is slipping. The sister is holding up her hand for a cookie. The window is open. Yes. Where is it overflowing? Mother is drying the dishes. That's it. The stool is slipping. Okay. What about down here? The water is dripping. That's what I meant. I meant flowing over. I probably missed that.", "adrso263": " Okay, there's the picture. Everything is in there. Do you need mishaps? Or whatever? Yeah. Uh-huh. Do you want me to start at any particular time? Mm-hmm. You can start now. Well, top left, cookie being removed from the cookie jar. Handing cookie to sister. About to upend on the three-legged stool. Mother drying dishes, sink overflowing onto the floor. Do you want action type things? Yeah. I said drying dishes. Water overflowing into the sink. Mm-hmm. Heck of a lot to do with it. Okay, good.", "adrso280": " There's the picture. This little boy has his hand in the cookie jar. He's gotten up on a stool, which is tipping over. And sister is standing there, wanting some cookies too. And all of this is behind grandmother's back. She's washing dishes. And the water's running over. She must be daydreaming. The water's running over onto the floor. She doesn't seem to notice it. And there are a couple of dishes there. She must be drying the dishes. They look dried on the counter. The one in her hand, I thought she'd just taken up. And then back, there's a yard. A sidewalk. And another wing of the house with a window. And curtains. Curtains, there she has a window, got the sink. Which is nice. Big bright and red oil. And a little book on it. And another nice thing. What are you? She said, coming in. Okay. I don't think I meant that. You did fine. That's great.", "adrso270": " The mother's drying the dish and the water's running over.

And the lady has one foot in back of the other. And it looks like the window's open. And she's already dried some dishes there on the counter. The cabinet door's open. Let's see. And it's on the floor. And the boy's trying to get the food out of the cabinet. And the sink is running over. I guess I said that. Okay. That's fine. He's handing one cookie to the other girl. Okay.

There's a girl standing beside him. Go ahead. And she's reaching for the cookie that he has in his hand and she has her right finger up to her left. There's a woman, particularly the mother, standing at the sink, drying dishes, and the sink is overflowing with water onto the floor. She just let the action. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. We're getting ready toendawn herggak in and she's dying. Step right up. You're gonna spray that one on the neck too. Right there? Yeah. Okay. She's coming out. Pausing. That water coming out of her passport. Okay. Mm-hmm. Good. Thank you."}
